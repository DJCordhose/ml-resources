Workshop (1.5 hours)

Within the community of coders “being an architect” or “doing architecture” is often looked down upon. When referring to
architecture we often mean drawings of boxes and arrows that are pointless and have not relation to what is really being
done.

However, architecture can also be defined as the important decision, whatever they are
(https://martinfowler.com/architecture/). There always are important decisions and the code only contains the how and
not the why. Such decisions often have to be made early in a project, require compromise and if being bad have the
potential to make the project fail.

In this workshop we will look at the important decisions of projects, how to identify and justify then. This is
independent of any technology or approach. We will also discuss how to document those decisions, so people actually
trust them to be relevant and up to date.

There will be exercises on paper to be solved in teams.

### Gauge by show of hands

What do you think when you think about someone doing architectural work?
* Probably can't code
* Maybe used to code
* Can not go beyond the level of boxes and arrows
* Can talk, but not act
* Tries to deflect responsibility

_Please be as open as possible_

### (Software) Architecture

* the important decisions, whatever they are
  * once taken they are often hard to change
  * often have to be made early in a project
  * require compromise
  * if being bad have the potential to make the project fail
* there always are important decisions
  * if you don't choose explicitly, there always is on implicit choice

### Our Challenge for today: predicting risks

* We do architectural work for a highly innovative car insurance company.
* Unlike other insurance companies, we determine the rate based on the estimated number of accidents per customer.
* Objective: how many accidents will the potential customers have?

### Requirements

1. *High Accuracy* - should have 80% or more cases correct
1. *Explainability* - we need to explain how we come to the conclusion
1. *Stability* - a new version of the software should not behave totally different
1. *Resistance Against Manipulation* - it should be hard to find out how the software works to resist manipulation
1. *Ressourcefulness* - should scale well and not use a lot of resources to run

_requirements typically are vague, sometimes user stories help making this clearer_

### Features to draw conclusion from

* driver
  * *training*: 0/1, the driver completed driver training
  * *age*: Age of the driver in years
* vehicle  
  *emergency_braking*: 0/1, the vehicle has an emergency braking system 
  * *braking_distance*: Braking distance from speed 100
  * *power*: Power in KW
* *miles*: Annual mileage
* to predict
  * *risk_group*: Classification into group based on risk

### Why document?

1. Making things explicit
   * making sure proper reasoning has been done in the first place
   * provide a basis for discussion
1. Reference
   * something used by developer roles to actually make the software
   * for people coming back into the project at a later point
   * having your back
1. Requirements change or get more obvious and explicit over time - we can not look into the future
   * If this happens do we know what decision we took based on what perceived requirement and assumption?

### Hands-On: Choose a suitable solution

*Pair up in teams of at least two and at most four people*

<!-- * Hint: there is one nugget that looks good, but has serious flaws -->
* What information are you lacking?
* Olli plays be the role of 
  * the PM detailing the product
  * the developer giving information about the architectural nuggets
  * realistically (hopefully) simulating the scarcity and the lack of commitment

1. What kind of documentation did you write?
   * Did you feel comfortable with the form chosen?
   * Did you really have a choice?
1. How did you feel wile making your decision?
   * Did you feel stressed? What stressed you out?
   * Did you feel up to the task of making a choice in the first place?
   * Who was lacking deeper technical insights?
   * who wanted more emotional support

### Typical things happening in production

1. Smartass Lawyer Attack
   * can you explain your decision?
1. price comparison service tries to outsmart you
   * are you prone to adversarial attacks 
1. Drift
   * driver assistance becomes prevalent - prediction of risk no longer valid
   * are you able to create a stable new model
1. Investigative Journalism
   * there might be systematic age bias

_How do they affect your decision?_
  - Does the documentation help?
  - What assumptions have been invalidated?

### Architectural Work

_under high uncertainty and imperfect information ..._
1. find areas of important decisions (often solely based on experience and gut feeling)
1. match
   * (partially contradicting and incomplete or even only implicit) requirements - given by domain expert role - with
   * (vague) properties of (a mostly arbitrary selection of) architectural nuggets - given by technical expert role
   * while inferring priorities (because no one wants to give them) by making assumptions

### You need to earn respect as a software architect

_As an architect you need to have a certain level of technical understanding_
* implementation is key
  * without it you have a PowerPoint and not software
* need to have an idea what the boxes and arrows represent
  * what technology can be used to implement them
  * what effort is required
* for the details you might need to consult with an engineering role who is more into it
* it might require you to take basic courses in technology used for implementation (no matter how senior you are)

### Doing Software Architecture requires an unusual skill set

*Introverts vs Architecture*
- you need to be comfortable communicating
- and you need to have a technical clue
- at the same time you might have to communicate with people who are
  - not comfortable communicating, but have technical clue and
  - vice versa
- you might have to go up and down the elevator (https://architectelevator.com/)
