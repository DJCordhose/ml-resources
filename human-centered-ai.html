- Green Screen, Blue Screen
- Papa Schlumpf ist auch blau
- Kunstprojekt mit Surface
- Histogram von Hue für Hand Erkennung
  - Unfortunately, we only have the main color in common, there are certain variations, though
- How did I find out? OpenCV swaps color channels
- SB: wie sehen Menschen aus? Wie die 4 Inginneure. Keine langen Haare, keine Hochsteckfrisuren, keine Mützen/Kappen, keine Riesen, keine Zwerge, keine Dicken 

actionable takeaways
- how image recognition works 
- why certain detectors fail (and why this is hard to fix)
- user experience and machine learning
- 

Learn how image recognition works in general. Why certain detectors fail (and why this is hard to fix). User experience and machine learning.

### Workshop

Title: Human Centered Artificial Intelligence

We, seen as humans, are the center of most applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
We either provide the input for the system, are the ones creating the systems, or are the ones who have to deal with its outputs. 
In either case humans are an important factor. 

This workshop is composed of two parts addressing the cases mentioned above. 

In the first part we will talk about humans as providers of input to an AI system. As it turns out, biases brought into the 
system by the engineers has an impact independent of whether the system is machine learned or rule based. 
This often happens unconsciously. We will do a series of demonstrations and shared interactive experiments, 
among them turning the audience into martians. 

The second part of the workshop is about user experience in AI systems. 
Systems covering AI by definition enter areas previously thought to be exclusively in the human domain. 
Unlike a calculator that does calculations faster and more reliably than a human, 
an AI system requires special attention as it might contradict our own judgement or calculation. The question that arises is: 
Who is right, the machine or the human. So we need a specialized idea of user experience that also shapes the use case.

In this interactive workshop (no coding) we will go through a series of demonstrations and shared interactive experiments.

Footnote: When using the term "artificial intelligence" we do not mean the marketing term, but something more technical abstract level than machine learning.

### Racism is a very sensitive topic

Dr. Kassandra Ford (@kassthefish) twitterte um 3:53 PM on Fr., Feb. 11, 2022:
Found out that yesterday my old PhD department hosted a recently-hired prof to give a talk titled "Measuring Skin Tone to Build Knowledge About Identities and Inequalities: Direct Instrument Assessment and Human Ratings."

UMMMMM!!!?!?!?!?? https://t.co/Hrgne38NYM

### Interpretabilty / explanation

* https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3511299
* Everyone racking their brains about explainable AI should have a look at the cognitive science literature on how people explain their own behavior. People have very detailed explanations. The only problem is that these explanations can be very wrong!
  * https://twitter.com/gershbrain/status/1490696366405914626
  * The social aspects can play a large role as well, ie. who the explanation is for. https://t.co/slfEgGtcFi (https://twitter.com/mptouzel/status/1490721279825088513?t=t6Zl_LUMb8Wo1kNJDLxjRg&s=03)

### Ux and ML

[ ] Often humans come in direct contact with Machine Learning
[ ] Requires special attention as it enters the domain of human intelligence
[ ] This is not always the case, often other systems are in between
[ ] https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml
[ ] http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/
[ ] For end users
[ ] Does a door open?
[ ] Does the laptop log you in?
[ ] Need to be sutble: all these changes and what has become possible in the lifetime of a person
[ ] For professional users
[ ] Recommendation
[ ] How certain is the model?
[ ] How good does it have to be?
[ ] Shall not get on your nerves
[ ] Only make a proposal when you wait for a while
[ ] The longer you wait the lower the certainty has to be

### Links
* One thing it took me quite a while to understand is how few bits of information it's possible to reliably convey to a large number of people. When I was at MS, I remember initially being surprised at how unnuanced their communication was, but it really makes sense in hindsight (https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1487228574608211969?t=UKPzhICu-4KIIkkQgEH4xw&s=03)
* On that note, we're building an “applied alignment” team to make sure that the models OpenAI deploys are aligned. It’s ML research, engineering, and social science. Our current job posting is for RE (https://t.co/Y4eCV36PZw), but if you’re interested please send me a message!
